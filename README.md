# Data_Visualization

This project looks at a dataset that has data about flights covered by several airlines/carriers across several cities in the US. Since the dataset is very large (nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed) I chose to only use a segment of the data for this project - flight data for December 2019 and December 2020.
The project is split into two main parts. 
Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
In this first part, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on a dataset. I used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns, and relationships.
The analysis in this part consists of simple univariate relationships, bivariate and multivariate relationships. I identified the  main feature(s) of interest in your dataset then explored the forementioned relationships and provided a variety of plots - bar, histograms, scatter, boxplots e.t.c


See the Readme for a summary of my findings and key insights for presentation.

Part 2 - Explanatory Data Visualization
This part consists of explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored and a slide deck of some of the exploratory tasks
